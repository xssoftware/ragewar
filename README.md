=======

History based online strategy  game
-----------------------------------

Have you ever wondered what it's like to build a civilization from the Stone Age and see it growing through ancient history till the time when human beings will no longer consider themselves as Homo sapiens ... Here you have the opportunity to lead a real human civilization throughout thousands of years of bloodshed and marvelous discoveries.

You will begin at the dawn of Mankind with a small village where our ancestors have to struggle every day for their survival with primitive tools and weapons. As a responsible leader, you will lead your people through the ages, through glorious battles and wealth and prosperity. Your empire will grow stronger while following your military or economical doctrine.

The city you are building will expand and with every new age it will become more beautiful and glorious than before. As a skillful engineer, you will choose how to expand your city - as a military commander you will fortify your defenses and lead your troops into battle. As a profit hunter you will choose your trade offers with other civilizations in the world. And finally but most important as a wise leader you will forge strong alliances with the other monarchs around you.

Rage War is online mass multiplayer strategy game inspired from the Human evolution through different ages in history. You will develop a city from a tiny village to a marvelous megapolis with a shining castle, fortifications and wonderful buildings.

Enormous technology tree will unlock new buildings, units and upgrades, allowing you to change your strategy and tactics in the city development and your military campaigns.

With the advanced trading system, you can make or take offers on the global market or within your own alliance. You can always build your own brewery and find out if the market is favorable for the best ale on the planet. You are more of a wine person? No problem, you can build a wine cellar too and celebrate your progress in a more ... classy way.

Scout your neighbors and if you are a military type leader, find the weakness on their defenses and crush them! The only thing you have to know is that there is no always-win combination of army units. Your enemy can always change their defenses which most certainly will cause changes in your military tactic as well.

Never forget that your neighbors can be your enemy ... or your most trusted ally on your glorious march through history of Mankind.
